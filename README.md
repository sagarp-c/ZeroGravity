# PACE Data Web App

## Overview
The **PACE** mission aims to extend and improve NASA's more than 20-year record of satellite observations related to global ocean biology, aerosols, and clouds⁴. As part of our hackathon project, we're building a web app to enhance understanding of PACE satellite data.

## What is PACE?
- **Plankton**: PACE observes microscopic life in the ocean, including phytoplankton, which play a crucial role in Earth's carbon cycle.
- **Aerosol**: The mission also studies atmospheric aerosols, which impact climate and air quality.
- **Cloud**: PACE provides insights into cloud properties and their interactions with the ocean.

## Key Features of Our Web App
1. **Data Visualization**: We'll visualize PACE data, including ocean color measurements and polarimetry data on clouds and aerosols.
2. **Educational Content**: Explain the significance of PACE data and its impact on climate research, fisheries health, and more.
3. **Interactive Maps**: Show PACE satellite orbits and regions of interest.
4. **Community Engagement**: Connect with other PACE enthusiasts and researchers.

## Getting Started
1. **Sign up**: https://sagarp-c.github.io/ZeroGravity/.
2. **Explore the Data**: Dive into PACE data using the provided datasets.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions! Feel free to add features, fix bugs, or improve documentation. Please follow our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Acknowledgments
We'd like to express our gratitude to the PACE mission team at NASA for making this incredible data available to the public⁵. Let's explore the ocean and atmosphere together!
